overview-interactive/
    this is a small library built to support displaying your
    project intuitively. It's built to run perfectly with
    [overview-tools](http://github.com/atstp/overview-tools)

overview-interactive/.gitignore
overview-interactive/OVERVIEW
    the overveiw of the project's structure, either the source for
    what you're looking at, or the file itself

overview-interactive/bundle.js
    _not included in a `git clone`_

    this is what you get if you `npm run bundle`
    (it's also available by default in the npm install)

overview-interactive/package.json
overview-interactive/lib/
    a mirror image of `overview-interactive/src/`, but the stuff here
    is compiled ES5, courtesy of [`babel`](http://babeljs.io/)

overview-interactive/src/
    ES2015 Woot! it uses _babel_ and _browserify_ to make you
    a nice little package.

overview-interactive/src/Entry.js
    Each entry -- a file, it's path, comments, and children -- is used
    as the argument to the `Entry` class' constructor. They make things
    easier to work with.

overview-interactive/src/Project.js
    the wrapper for displaying things. It splits comments out separately,
    builds the box it lives in, and handles inserting it into the document

overview-interactive/src/overview-to-json.js
    this module is a single function: it converts the source-text from an
    overview file to a JSON tree-like object representing the directory
    structure.

overview-interactive/src/browser.js
    Attaches the project, `Project` to the window as a factory function
    (called **`overview`**) handling function signatures and eventually
    delagating to the `Project` class.
